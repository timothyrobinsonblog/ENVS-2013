      <div class="title">Why?</div>
      
      <p>This is your chance to join the most important political fight of our generation. Climate change is no longer just a scientific or economic issue — it’s a political issue. And that’s an excellent thing because every major change in history has come from collective and organised action. We’re told to recycle, to consume better, to wait for more data, but nothing matters more than political will. No more studies, no more stalling, no more greenwashing. We need action demanded by an organised democracy, and we need you for this. Join us in Sydney. Be loud. Be counted. Be heard.</p>
      
      <div class="title">Who?</div>
      
      <p><span class="text-styling">Helene and Jim will be there. Will you?</span> In previous years, up to 100,000 have attended, some of the biggest protests in Australian history.</p>

      <div class="title">What? When? Where?</div>

      <p>A Climate March to demand action on climate change. <span class="text-styling-2">19th July, Sydney. We’ll start in Hyde Park and end at the harbour.</span></p>
