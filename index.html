      <div class="title">Why?</div>
      
      <p>EDIT ME: This is an inviation to get involved in the most important political event of our generation. Because every change in history has come from [[link here: concerted and organised action.]] The debate around climate change has been increasingly politicized – and that is an excellent thing. We’re told to focus on the science or the economics or indiviudla actions, but it’s political will that’s needed. No more studies, no more measuring, no more greenwashing, just action demanded by an organised democracy. Helene wants you to get involved politically in the climate debate because without deep and lasting political engagement, then nothing will change. The solutions presented are often focused on the economics or the science or the individual, but a challenge to the system that we live and breathe every day is what is needed. This can’t be done without collective action. So this is an inviration to get involved politically. (Giving these decisions to technocrats.)</p>
